General-purpose definition assistant designed to assist with the definition of magic getters.

Code was pulled from [daft-object](https://github.com/SignpostMarv/daft-object/commit/359efead818d66cfd20f3e7f6f72d7ed51483d3c), with the goal of child-classes to define sources for properties in addition to `DaftObject::DaftObjectProperties()` and `AbstractDaftObject::PROPERTIES`.
